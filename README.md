# DialogueStudioFlows
In above directories you can find HowTo- and Solution- flows and documentation for Anywhere365 Dialogue Studio.

## HowTo flows
Shorter HowTo flows show you working building blocks of Anywhere365 Dialogue Studio flows. Examples HowTo flows are database, Sharepoint or file access, Dialogue Studio Event bus node or Incoming call node. HowTo flows are a handson start for quickly learning Dialogue Studio.

## Solution flows
Solution flows show you full working end to end Anywhere365 Dialogue Studio flows. These solution flows give you a working solution for a customer demo or are a starting point for your custom Anywhere365 Dialogue Studio integration or solution. 

## Download
How to use above flow content? You can clone this full Github repository and get and sync all the samples in one go. See green Code button top right. Most files are quite small. I use free Microsoft Visual Studio Code as my editor and Git client but you can use your preferred tooling. Or you can just copy (paste later) an individual .json file content. In Dialogue Studio go to the hamburger menu, top right, and choose Import then paste.

Each flow typically needs some configuration e.g. connect to your unique Anywhere365 server, ucc or database.
Flows may have requirements on other nodes that you may need to add to the Palette. In Dialogue Studio go to hamburger menu, top right, then choose Manage Palette, then Install tab, type the name of the new node you want to add, e.g. SQL.

DefaultUCCsimple_Solution is a good choice as you first flow and to test your new Dialogue Studio deployment.
