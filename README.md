## Quick start

### Option A — Import a JSON flow
1. Open your Dialogue Studio environment.
2. Press **`Ctrl + i`** (or **Menu → Import**) and paste or upload the JSON from a sample folder.
3. Review any **Function** or **Configuration** nodes and fill in required values (URLs, keys).
4. Click **Deploy** and test.

### Option B — Connect Dialogue Studio to a remote Git
If you prefer to work with version control:
1. Create a Git repository in your Git hosting (e.g., Azure DevOps).
2. Follow the **Remote Git** setup for Dialogue Studio (clone URL, credentials).
3. Pull this repository’s contents (or copy selected sample folders) into your remote.
4. Use the **Commit**/**Push**/**Pull** workflow inside Dialogue Studio to manage changes.

---

## Prerequisites

- An active **AnywhereNow Dialogue Studio** instance with access to the necessary platform services (UCC, connectors, Event Bus).
- For cloud integrations (e.g., **Azure Cognitive Services**, **Microsoft Graph**, **Dynamics 365**, **Salesforce**), ensure credentials, app registrations, and any allow-listing are in place.
- Database samples require a reachable SQL instance and appropriate credentials.

---

## Configure & run

1. **Open the sample flow** and locate the **Configuration**/**Function** nodes.
2. **Set secrets & endpoints** (keys, base URLs, tenant IDs, queue/skill names, etc.).
3. **Adapt routing** to your skills/UCC names and business rules.
4. **Test the happy path**, then try common error paths (timeouts, 4xx/5xx, auth failures).
5. **Log & observe**: most samples include debug nodes—leave these on during initial testing.
