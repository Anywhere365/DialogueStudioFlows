# DialogueStudioFlows
In above directories you can find HowTo-, Solution- flows and documentation for Anywhere365 Dialogue Studio.

Each flow typically needs some configuration e.g. connect to your unique Anywhere365 server and ucc.
Flows may have requirements on other nodes that you may need to add to the Pallet first.
